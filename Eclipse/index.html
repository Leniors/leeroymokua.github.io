        <h1>Solar Eclipses</h1>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Occurrence:</h2>
            <p>Solar eclipses happen when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking part or all of the Sun's light from reaching the Earth's surface.</p>
            <h2>Types:</h2>
            <p>
                <h2>Total Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                <p>Occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun, casting a shadow on a specific region of the Earth.</p>
                <h2>Partial Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                <p>Happens when the Moon only partially covers the Sun, resulting in a crescent-shaped Sun.</p>
                <h2>Annular Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                <p>Occurs when the Moon covers the center of the Sun, leaving a ring or "annulus" of the Sun's outer edge visible.</p>
            </p>
            <h2>Visibility:</h2>
            <p>Solar eclipses are visible only from specific geographic regions on Earth, depending on the eclipse type and path of totality.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Lunar Eclipses</h1>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Occurrence:</h2>
            <p> Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to be cast on the Moon's surface.</p>
            <h2>Types:</h2>
            <p>
                <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse:</h2>
                <p>The entire Moon is immersed in Earth's shadow, giving it a reddish hue (often called a "Blood Moon").</p>
                <h2>Partial Lunar Eclipse:</h2>
                <p>Only a portion of the Moon enters the Earth's shadow, resulting in a partial darkening of the lunar surface.</p>
            </p>
            <h2>Visibility:</h2>
            <p>Lunar eclipses are visible from the entire nighttime hemisphere of Earth.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Frequency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Eclipses are relatively frequent but may not be visible from a specific location for years. On average, there can be several solar and lunar eclipses in a year, but a total solar eclipse may be visible from a specific location roughly every 18 months.</p>
        <h1>Path of Totality</h1>
        <p>The path of totality refers to the narrow strip of Earth's surface where a total solar eclipse is visible. This path varies with each eclipse, and eclipse chasers often travel to specific locations to witness these rare events.</p>
        <h1>Safety</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>It's crucial to emphasize that looking directly at a solar eclipse without proper eye protection can cause permanent eye damage. Observers should use certified solar viewing glasses or indirect viewing methods.</p>
        <h1>Cultural Significance</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Eclipses have held cultural and historical significance throughout human history, often inspiring myths, legends, and scientific discoveries.</p>

            <h1>Take Away:</h1>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <p>Eclipse occurrences are remarkable celestial phenomena that continue to fascinate people worldwide. They provide opportunities for scientific research, education, and a sense of wonder about the cosmos. As such, eclipse calendars and resources play an essential role in helping enthusiasts and the public track and appreciate these awe-inspiring events.</p>
